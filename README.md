I created an **Interactive Rating Component** as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI) challenge. This interactive rating component allows users to rate feedback from 1 to 5. It is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The component includes engaging interactions, such as button effects, and displays a "thank you" message to the user upon rating submission.
